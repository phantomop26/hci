## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts so each user can manage their own tasks.

- **Search and Filter**: Add a search bar or filter option to quickly find tasks.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Integrate email or in-app notifications for upcoming or overdue tasks.
- **Task Archive**: Allow users to archive completed tasks instead of deleting them outright.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode for a more customizable and visually appealing experience.
- **Deploy to Cloud**: Deploy the app on a cloud platform like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud** so it can be accessed online by anyone.
- **Responsive Design**: Improve the UI to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
